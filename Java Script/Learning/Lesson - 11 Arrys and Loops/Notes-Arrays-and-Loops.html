      Arrays:
        Another type of value
        Represents list of values
        const myArray = [10, 20, 30];
      Change a number in array:
        myArray[0]=99;

      In array we can include number, strings, booleans, objects, and arays too
      Example: [1, 'hello', true, {name: 'socks'}, [1,2]]

      console.log(typeof [1, 2]);
      Output -> Object. Because an array is an object(but its special type of object)

      console.log(Array.isArray([1, 2])); true

      As array is an object, it will have properties and methods

      One usefull propertiy is .length

      console.log(myArray.length); o/p: 3

      usefull method: .push() -> add a value to the end of the array
              console.log(myArray.push(100)); o/p 4
        console.log(myArray); o/p 4 and array

        Another method: .splice()
        Removes a value from the array
        It takes two values: first one is index and secnd one is how many values to remove from the index
        Ex: myArray.splice(0, 3);
        Here, splice will removefirst 3 values from index 0 which means it removes index 0, 1, 2

        Loops:
        Loops let us run our code over and over

        Accumulator Pattern:
        1. Create a variable to store the result
        2. Loop through the array and update the result
        Example for accumulator pattern is Ading all elements in an array


        Project Todo-list:
          Algorithm:
            1. Create array to store todos
            2. When we click "Add"
            3. Get text from textbox
            4. Add it to array
            5. Console.log() the array

            So we created an empty array and function called addTodo() whenver we click "Add" button this fucntion will be called. To access the text from the <input> we are going to use document.querySelector(); so we are giving class to the input to use in querySelector(); 
            
            As this is a <input> we cant use .innerHTML or .innerText , we can only use .value.
            and we pushed the text to the array, using .push()

            we used inputElement.value = ' '; to remove the added todoList from the <input> after clicking add button
