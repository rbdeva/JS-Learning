Event Listeners:
onclick = click
onkeydown = key press
onscroll = scrolling
onmouseenter = hovering over
onmouseleave = stop hovering over
... and many more

Every event listener gets an event object

     onkeydown=" 
     console.log('typing');
     console.log(event.key); it will print whatever value or key we typed



     String(25); This convert 25 into String, String is a built in function

     consle.log('25'-5);
     Output will be 20 because if a string only contains a number then Js automatically converts into number. This is called Type Coercion or automatically type conversion and it is not recommened because adding  working differently.

     Window object: Another buit in object

     document object represents the webpage while window oject represent the browser.

     Everything inside the browser insdie the window object

     inside the browser includes te complete webpage,window.document, 
     window.console.log, pop ups,

     so window.document is same as document object and console.log same as window.console.log.

     window.alert();

     window object has a shortcut sowe dont have to type "window", JS will automatically window for us
