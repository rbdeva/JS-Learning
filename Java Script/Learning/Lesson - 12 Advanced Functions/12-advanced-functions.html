    Functions  are values.
    Types of value: numbers, strings, booleans
    example: const num =2;
    like the same way we can save a function inside a variable;
    example:
    const

/*
   We are accessing the abve function using a variable so we dont need function name anymore, s we can remove greeting
   const function1 = function greeting() 

   Ths is called as anonymous function: a function withput a name

   Hoisting: It will let us call a  function before we write it and hoisting doesnt work when we store a function in a  varaible

*/

/*
Te below exmple is a method, function inside a object

*/

    const object1 = {
      num: 2,
      fun: function greetng(){

we can remve fnction name

/*
The above example is called passing a value to a function,
As function are also a value, we can also passs a function into a function

In he below example we called param(); instead of console..log because its a function

This is called passing a function into a function
run(function(){
  console.log('hello4');
});Tis is called a callback function
*/
function run(param){

/*
setTimeout() - allows us to run a function in the future and is a built in function and takes 2 parameters
1. a function we want to run in the future
2. how long to wait before running this functiom in ms

1000 ms= one sec;

*/

  console.log('timeout');
}, 3000  );

/* It will print timeout after 3 second */

/* 

Asynchronous code: wont wait for a line to finish before going to the next line.
setTimeout() function  wont wait 3 seconds to finish it just set timer and immediately goes to the next line and this is called asynchronous code

Synchronous code: will wait for one line to finish before ging to the next line.

*/
setTimeout(function(){
  console.log('timeout');
  console.log('timeout2'); /* the code insde this function is synchronous code and it will run line by line .
  
  All code we normally write always a synchrnous code, run line by line.
  The only few times  the code becomes asynchronous is when we use special fnctions like setTimeout();

  Advantage of setTimeout being asynchronous is : it wont stop/block out code for 3 seconds, it just set timer in the background.
  Example i alarm clock timer.


  */
}, 3000  );


console.log('next line');


/* setInterval() is another built in function and it takes two parameters
1. A function we want to run in the future
2. A number in milliseconds

It will keep running the function for every 3 seconds.

setInterval is also asynchrnous

It will KEEP running in the future
*/
setInterval( function(){
  console.log('interval')

/* Another way to loop through an array.
Earlier we loopthorugh using for loop. 
Another way is using a method called .forEach()

*/

[
  'make dinner',
  'make dishes',
  'watch youtube'
].forEach(function(value, index){
  console.log(index);
  console.log(value);
});

/* 
Here, the first value saves in the parameter and runs the function and then it will take the second value , save it in the parameter and run the function.

Another feature is: we can give another parameter and it is index. For first value index will be 0 second value index will be 1...
*/

/* 
cntinue let us skip to the next iteration
.forEach() method dont have continue so we can use by return statement

for example: if the value is wash dishes we are going to skip it

*/

[
  'make dinner',
  'make dishes',
  'watch youtube'
].forEach(function(value, index){
  if(value === 'wash dishes'){
    return;  /* Does same thing as continue */
  }
  console.log(index);
  console.log(value);
});

/* break; let us exit from the loop earlier
But theres no easy way to break forEach loop. if we need to use break thenits better to use for loop.
