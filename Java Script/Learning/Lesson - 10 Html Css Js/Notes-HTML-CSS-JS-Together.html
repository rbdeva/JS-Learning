    /*

    So we can give two class names for same element because one class can be used by JS and one by HTML and class names can be separted by space
    

    Remainder: We can get html elements to JS by using document.querySelector() and these html elememts are javascript objects and will have properties such as innerText and innerHTML.

    .classList is alos similar kind of property which gives us cntrol of the class attribute

    classList is an object and it has properties and methods.

    one methid is .add(). it has an class to the element
    EXAMPLE: butoonElement.classList.add('is-subscribed');

    Now we can use the class named called is-subscribed

    classList has another method called remove()

    Ex: buttonElement.classList.remove('is-subscribed');

    As you can see we will nly use dot . while writng class nam ein querySelector but not in classList. so we can only use . in querySelector();

    background-color: transparent;
    See through: Which means we can see background color of the body
    
    Remainder:
    border: border-width solid/dotted/dashed border-color;

    Points to note down:

    So, you have three images with same class name for example: when you look into rock paper scissors project we can same class name for three images but the size pof each image after using tarnsperent: background-color is different so its better to use height and width than padding.

    So if you add images to a button and give class names always feel the differenc between image and button. and give class names for button and images separately. For better understanding go to: project called 10-rock-paper-scissors we used at the beginning of the project
    
    Link JS to HTML:
    <script src="10-rock-paer-scissors.js"> </sccript>


      What I leanred:
      1. Reviewd CSS
      2. classList
      3. Finished Project
      4. Organize H C and JS
